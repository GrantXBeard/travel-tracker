## Project Specs

Travel Tracker is an application built in week 10 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The goal of this group [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html) was to solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- Creating a robust testing suite using TDD
- Utilizing Lighthouse and Wave for Accessibility
- Making network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Utilizing third party packages
- Creating an enjoyable user experience

## Setup

- Fork this project to your own Github account
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/GrantXBeard/travel-tracker) to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Run `npm install` from your command line
- Run `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
- Run `npm install dayjs` to install dayJS
- Run `npm install chart.js` to install Chart.js
- Fork and clone the the [Travel Tracker API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/GrantXBeard/travel-tracker) to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Run `npm install` from your command line and then `npm start`
- The browser should then deploy using a local host
- Find the line that says Project is running at: [http://localhost:8080/]
- Copy and paste that URL into your browser into your browser.
- Now the application set up and ready to use!

## Testing

- Make sure you ran `npm install`,
- Run your test suite using the command:
