## Project Specs

Travel Tracker is a project application built in mod 2 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). The goal of this [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html) was to solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- Creating a robust testing suite using TDD
- Utilizing Lighthouse and Wave for Accessibility
- Making network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Utilizing third party packages
- Creating an enjoyable user experience

- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/GrantXBeard/travel-tracker) to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Run `npm install` from your command line
- Run `npm start`
- This will run the Webpack in the terminal so you can view and use the application in your browser
